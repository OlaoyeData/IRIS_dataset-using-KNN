# IRIS_dataset using KNN
 A project that applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the Iris dataset.

# Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 

# Features
Classification of iris flowers using KNN,
Evaluation of model performance,
Visualization of results
